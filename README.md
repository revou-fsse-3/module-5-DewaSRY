# React unit testing

on this branch i was done all retirement to do unit testing, there is big project with so much file but there is all necessary component and function already being test

## Folder structure where unit testing can be found

    ./src
        - ./component
            -   ./common
                -   __test__
            -   ./container
                -   __test__
            -   ./context
                -    __test__

        -   ./feature
            -   ./fetch
                -   __test__ --> use to hit the real api make sure tu
                 unComment the setup file on vite config to test it
                  but other test might be broken

            -   ./query
                -   __test__
            -   ./utils
                -   __test__
